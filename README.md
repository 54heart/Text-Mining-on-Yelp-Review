# Text-Mining-on-Yelp-Review

### Backgroud and questions of interests:
Restaurants are essential in people's lives and most of us have experience of rating and writing reviews for a restaurant. The goal of this project is to perform data analysis on the Yelp restaurant dataset, which consists of customer review texts, restaurant rankings, location information, etc. from a variety of restaurants.

At a high level, we want to find out which attributes of the restaurants lead to higher restaurant ratings and whether we can make further inference about the restaurant using text reviews. More specifically, our questions of interests consist of 3 perspectives: user, restaurant, and Yelp. For users, we want to study their rating and reviewing patterns. For restaurants, we want to find out the characteristics of high rating restaurants. For Yelp, we want to study the characteristics of reviews for better recommendations for its users.

By gathering insights about the customer base and developing strategic factors that would influence a customerâ€™s decision to visit a particular restaurant, not only can we help diners find the most desired restaurant by attributes such as quality of a restaurant or best cuisines, but also we can provide recommendations for restaurants to expand their business by attracting more customers and by improving clients experiences and targeting particular customers. In addition, for Yelp's perspective, we want to help Yelp to improve its recommendation system.

### Dataset Description:
We chose the Yelp dataset from Kaggle because the data is feasible and has potential due to large volumes (10GB). Besides, since the information is gathered from the Yelp website, which is one of the most renowned review platforms which had a monthly average of 76.7 million unique visitors via its mobile website in 2019, it is authentic and will help us develop practical insights.

The dataset includes 5.2 million user reviews of 174,000 businesses in 11 metropolitan areas in four countries. However, our project will only be focusing on data of restaurants in Nevada, which is the state with the highest total amount of review counts across all U.S. states.

We acquired 7 datasets in csv format: yelp_business_attributes.csv, yelp_business.csv, yelp_business_hours.csv, yelp_checkin.csv, yelp_tip.csv, yelp_review.csv, yelp_user.csv.
